# Citizen Hacman Commitment

## Introduction

Hackspace Manchester is something we do together. It is a community. The infrastructure (building, equipment, tools, electric, internet etc) provides the foundations, and people working together with shared understandings and expectations are what provide a place of strong community.

Every member is a citizen of the Hackspace Community and as such must follow the rules and guidelines in place to ensure that the community can exist safely and cohesively.

The Citizen Hacman Commitment is what we expect from all Hackspace Citizens and explains how you can play your part in building, maintaining, and growing our community.

Examples included in the Citizen Hacman Commitment are just that, this is not an exhaustive list of behaviours that may be considered in breach of the rules.

As a Citizen of Hacman… I am committed to:

## Membership Conditions

As a Hackspace Citizen it is essential that you act responsibly and safely within the Space this includes but is not limited to:

-   Using appropriate PPE. Hackspace Manchester provides relevant PPE including goggles, breathing masks, gloves, hearing protection etc and these should be used where appropriate.

## Rule 1: Be excellent to each other (follow the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement)

A hacker should treat each and every other hacker with the respect we feel we deserve ourselves.

  

We want our Hackspace to be somewhere that people can enjoy making things in a safe, harassment-free environment. Anybody who is in the Hackspace, attending an event as part of the Hackspace or is using any of the Hackspace communication channels (IRC, Mailing List or Telegram) is covered by the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement.

## Rule 2: Colour within the lines (and erase afterwards)

A hacker should keep their belongings safe and tidy so that other hackers are not inconvenienced or injured by them.

-   Follow the member’s storage guidelines
    
-   Don’t spread your stuff all over the place. Be willing to make room for others to work when needed
    
-   Tidy up any mess you make including tidying tools up and putting them back in the right places, disposing of rubbish appropriately
    
-   If you can please try and spend a few minutes tidying up other people’s mess (no one is perfect and someone may have left something out and by tidying it you’re helping keep the space enjoyable for everyone)
    

## Rule 3: Appreciate the Space!

A hacker should appreciate the space and that it is a shared space with other Hackspace Citizens .

  

All Hackspace Citizens are asked to respect and appreciate the space including but not limited to:

-   Members may bring guests into the space but are responsible for the actions of the guests. Guests must not use any equipment that requires an induction and should not be left alone in the space.

You may use the hackspace to further your business objectives but keep in mind that this is a shared space and that you won’t be given nor should you expect any priority or special treatment so please plan your deadlines accordingly.

## Rule 4: No Obligation

Hackspace Manchester does not employ any staff. Volunteers give up their spare time to assist with inductions on equipment and to help keep the space running, therefore, please bear in mind the following:

-   Equipment inductions are done by volunteers and there may be a wait for these
    
-   Maintenance of tools and equipment is done by volunteers which means that it may take a while for tools to be fixed if damaged/out of service
    
-   There is no obligation on Hackspace Manchester to purchase new tools and equipment. The majority of space tools were funded by member pledges so if you wish we had a tool or piece of equipment feel free to start a pledge on the [Forum](https://list.hacman.org.uk/)
    
-   There is no obligation on you to remain a member, membership is monthly rolling and can be cancelled at anytime using the Member’s system.
    

Just because someone is in the space doesn’t mean they are willing to induct you or fix something at that time
