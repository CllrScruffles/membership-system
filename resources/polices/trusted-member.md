**How To Get In**

The new space now has direct access at Street Level of Pollard Street East, look for the spray painted door with a city scape and multiple colour 

**Space access**
Once you have a working RFID card (either come to an open evening from 6pm on Wednesdays, or arrange with a member to let you in at another time), present it to the fob reader on the door and it will open

**Toilets**
The space currently has 1 toilet, it is not classed as an accessible toilet. We are currently working on the creation of a larger toilet which will be accessible.
