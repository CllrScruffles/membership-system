## Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement

As a condition of my membership to Hackspace Manchester I agree to the following:

1.  To follow the rules and guidelines of Hackspace Manchester
    
2.  Hackspace Manchester is a safe and inclusive space, free from violence, harassment, hate speech or exclusionary behaviour. This includes but is not limited to:
    

-   Making exclusionary jokes (even “ironically”)
    
-   Harassing or bullying of others (if you need to know what harassment covers see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment))
    
-   Using language or engaging in activity that is homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, sexist or otherwise exclusionary.
    
-   Engaging in any activity that involves others without all parties have given their consent (consent is defined as an informed, affirmative decision made freely and actively by all parties to engage in mutually acceptable activity).
    
-   Making an assumption of others including (but not limited) any perceived gender, sexual orientation or religion. If you are unsure then we would rather you asked and apologise if you are mistaken, however, respect other people’s privacy - they have the right not to answer any specific questions regarding their life.
    
-   People’s private lives are their own. Do not share details about others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing, relationship or financial status.
    

4.  Don’t judge - instead share your knowledge! Knowledge is not a competition - instead of judging people for what they don’t know, help them. Elitism is not welcome in the space. When doing this, remember that different people have different approaches, and may not want your help.
    

*Here at the Hackspace we make things, including mistakes! *

1.  Alcoholic drinks are permitted within the Hackspace however there should be no expectation or pressure on anyone to drink alcohol or conversely not to drink alcohol.
    

-   No tools or equipment should be operated by anyone under the influence of alcohol (or other substances)
    
-   Anyone who is obviously intoxicated will be asked to leave the space
    

3.  Respect other peoples belongings and space.
    

-   If possible ask before moving other people’s things.
    
-   If a machine appears to be in use check if the person has finished before taking over.
    
-   Don’t spread your things too far and tidy up as you go along - others may be trying to work in the same area. If you’re in the space on your own it’s easy, and tempting, to spread out, be aware of others coming in and be prepared to stop working in order to create space for them.
    
-   Follow the rules regarding storage and leaving projects out in the space.
    
-   Don’t mess around with other peoples’ projects and possessions without their permission.
    

5.  Discussion of how to make our Hackspace more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this “has gone too far” aren’t.
    

If you have any concerns about someone’s behaviour please let us know either in person or by emailing board@hacman.org.uk. If you do not wish to email the whole board, individual board members can be contacted via firstname@hacman.org.uk

## Consequences

#### Warnings

It is better to let someone know that their behaviour is liable to break the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement prior to it actually doing so than issue them with a warning.

Any member can issue a warning to a person whose behaviour has broken the code of conduct. Warnings should be reported to board@hacman.org.uk as soon as practical.

The report should include:

-   identifying information (name/nickname/description) of the person
    
-   the time and date the warning was issued
    
-   the behaviour that was in violation
    
-   the approximate time the behaviour occurred (if different to the warning)
    
-   the circumstances surrounding the incident
    
-   your identity
    
-   other people involved in the incident
    

#### Asking people to leave

Non-members

Any non-member who breaks the Code of Conduct can be asked to leave by any member, this includes non-members who are guests of members.

Members

If a board member is present they get to make a decision about whether one (or all) of the member(s) have to leave the space. If no board member is present any two or more members who have witnessed the incident(s) may ask the member (or members) to leave the space.

Do not put yourself in danger: if the situation requires it call the police.

Criminal behaviour will not be tolerated.

#### Restriction of access and termination of membership

Membership of the Hackspace may be restricted or terminated by the board for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines as to behaviour likely to cause restriction or termination of membership:

-   receiving three or more warnings from different sources within 6 months
    
-   continuing with behaviour after you have been asked to stop
    
-   a pattern of harassing behaviour, whether or not warnings have been issued
    
-   a single serious or obviously intentional offence such as taking compromising photographs (e.g. up their skirt), punching or groping someone
    

In the event of a serious accusation, the board reserves the right to suspend the accused’s access to the Hackspace while investigations are carried out.

#### Reporting inappropriate behaviour to the board

Any member can take a report from someone who has received harassment and passes that information to the board.

When taking a report from someone who has received harassment you should record faithfully what they say and reassure them that they are being taken seriously, however, you should avoid making specific promises regarding the actions of the board.

Ask for information the reporter has not volunteered (such as time and place of incident(s)) but do not pressure them into giving details if they do not feel comfortable doing so. Even if the report lacks key details (such as the identity of the person engaging in the harassing behaviour) it should still be recorded and passed to the board. If the reporter desires it arrange for an escort by a trusted person, contact a friend or family member to come and support them and/or contact the local police. Do not pressure the reporter into taking any actions they do not wish to. Respect the reporters’ privacy, do not discuss their report outside the reporting structure (don’t break the code of conduct yourself).

The report should include (as far as practicable):

-   the identity of the perpetrator (name/nickname/description)
    
-   time and date of the incident
    
-   time and date the report was received (if different)
    
-   the identity of the victim
    
-   your identity
    
-   the behaviour - this can be couched in general terms if the report requires it
    
-   the circumstances surrounding the incident
    
-   other people involved in the incident
    
-   Any other information you think is pertinent
    

#### Public statements

As general rule members of Hackspace Manchester should avoid making public statements about the behaviour of individual people in relation to the code of conduct.

The board will make as much detail about bans and current warnings as they feel appropriately available to all members.

### Summary

If you have been asked to stop behaving in a certain way, do so. It’s fine to ask what it is you’re doing that is upsetting the person if it is not clear, but you shouldn’t ask why the person is upset by it, it’s enough that they are.

If you have to take action to stop someone behaving in a way contrary to the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement do so, if possible consult with other members and/or the board, however, if action is required take it and explain later.
