<h3>Stairs</h3>
Use the blue door on Pollard Street East, and head up one flight of stairs.

<strong>The door code can be found on the your membership page of the membership system at https://members.hacman.org.uk </strong> (turn the silver handle to the RIGHT)
<h3>Lift</h3>
If you require the lift, use the loading entrance which is down the side of the building and on your left.

Code for the wooden gates: <strong>1290</strong>

Call the lift down, and open by pulling the doors open. It won't move until you type the code in:

Lift code: <strong>1280#</strong>

You then have ten seconds to select first floor,  the second white button from the bottom.

If the lift doesn't come, someone may have left a door open.
<h2>Finding our unit within the mill</h2>
Once through the door head up the stairs to the first floor (3rd door you come to).

You come out into this corridor:

Go through the double door with the no smoking sign above it

Follow the corridor round to the sofas. At the sofas turn right.

You should be confronted with a big metal door, our workshop is behind that.

<h2 id="Haccess">Space access</h2>
Haccess has been having some issues so Bob has set up the Big Metal Door with the access system from the old space. Once you have a working RFID card (either come to an open evening from 6pm on Wednesdays, or arrange with a member to let you in at another time), present it to the red light to the right of the door.
<h2 id="toilets">Toilets</h2>
There is a toilet that we share with the three other units behind the steel door - it is the rightmost door as you leave the hackspace.
