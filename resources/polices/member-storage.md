## Donating/Loaning Items to the Space

We regularly get people wishing to donate or loan items to the space, this can be something small like a length of cable right through to large tools and equipment like the lathe.

  

Is the item useful?

We ask that before you donate or loaning any item to the Hackspace, that you assess its usefulness to the Space and citizens of the space. The easiest way to do this is to ask. Use the telegram group or forum and see what people think.

### Where do I put the item?

If the item already has a home e.g Electrical Wire, Glue, Screwdrivers then place your donated/loaned item in the appropriate box, shelf etc. Other items should be placed on the black shelves in the corridor and may at any point be used by members for projects or may be binned if they are no longer deemed useful. Loaned items will have their owner informed and asked to remove.

### Loaned items Conditions.

Items on loan will remain the property of the member who owns them, these items should be labeled similar to a DNH label. Hackspace Manchester Board of Directors reserve the right to the ask any member who has loaned an item to the space to remove the item should it no longer be required. If a member who has loaned an item to the space ceases to be a member and does not remove the loaned item within 60 days (similar to Memberâ€™s storage items) the loaned item will then be considered donated to the space and the future of the tool (maintenance, renewal, updating, usefulness etc) will be determined by the board or an appropriate subcommittee.

  

Hackspace Manchester will not accept liability for any tools damaged whilst on loan to the space and whilst every care will be taken, mistakes and accidents happen.
