# Welcome to Hackspace Manchester!
## Here are some essentials...
Please read and complete this induction. You will not be able to access the space until this is complete   

<hr/>   

## We have house rules
Every member must follow the rules and guidelines in place to ensure that we continue to have an inclusive and welcoming community which can exist safely and cohesively.

Usually things work well, but when they don't we have rules in place.

➡️ The rules can be read at any time [here](https://hacman.org.uk/rules).

## We have a member handbook
We have a member handbook which provides a brief overview of the key aspects of a functioning hackerspace.

➡️ [There is a copy online](https://list.hacman.org.uk/t/member-handbook/2890/1) and there are two copies in the space for reference:
* One is by the lightswitches as you come in
* The other is on the member noticeboard.

**Please take a moment to flick through the member handbook so you're grounded in how the space operates**

## RFID Access
When you signed up you'll have selected to either have your fob posted to you, or to collect it.

### Postal fob
When you fill in your payment information, you'll be posted a fob and a welcome flyer. The fob grants you 24/7 access to the space.
This flyer will have the ID of the enclosed fob written on it, usually something like:
`ABCDEF12` or `AB12CD34`. The fob ID will be made up of numbers `0-9`, and letters `A-F`. 

### Collection
On the signup desk as you come in, you'll find a holder of fobs and a welcome leaflet. Choose a fob, then follow the instructions to add the fob to your account. Your fob will start working once your first payment has gone through.

You'll need to enter this ID into the membership system in order to link the fob to your account. This is easy - when it arrives:
* Click "Your Membership" in the left hand menu
* Click "Edit" in the top right
* Enter your key fob ID in the "Key Fob" section 
* Click save.

**Please note: your fob will not work until you have completed this induction, and your first payment has gone through.**

## Some equipment needs an induction

Inductions are mandatory for the more dangerous and expensive machines around the space.

These include but are not limited to:
* the laser cutter
* 3D printer 
* lathes (wood, metal)
* CNC
* and others... 
  
Our inductions are run by members, and are a mixture of face to face instructions and online. You can find out what tools need inductions and how to book them through the tools & equipment page here on the membership system. 

To book an induction click on the tool name under the tools & equipment page. You may need to pay an induction fee as some inductions require a small expense for test materials. **If the induction cost is £0 it's free - but you must click the button for the system to register you as requiring an induction**

Inductions are conducted in different ways, as stated on the tool page:
* Some inductions are simply reading the manual, or watching some videos so you understand how to use and maintail the tool, others are done in person. 
* Some are conducted online via Moodle at [https://moodle.hacman.org.uk] (https://moodle.hacman.org.uk) - to access this use your member system username and password. 
* Some tools such as the Laser Cutter require an in-person induction

Once you have done the above you will be enrolled onto the appropriate moodle course for the induction and you should also make contact with a trainer to arrange any required in person training this can be done via moodle or through telegram


## Members Storage
Active members are permitted to store some things within a 600x400mm space. You need to claim your space on the membership system, which correlates to a physical storage area in the hackspace. 

To Claim a storage space, find a place that works for you in the hackspace, note the ID, then go to the membership system, and in the "Member Storage" page, and simply find the corresponding number and click claim.  

If you no longer need your members storage space or you are leaving the hackspace please ensure you return the space. If not it will remain occupied until someone does a manual clearout - anything that is left after you leave may be destroyed, disposed of, moved or hacked.

## Large Project Storage
We have extremely limited space for the storage of large projects. This is detailed in the Member Handbook - but all projects stored there must be labelled appropriately with contact details, and be actively worked on.
