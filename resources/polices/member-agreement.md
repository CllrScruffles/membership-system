## You must follow the rules
Every member must follow the rules in place to ensure that everyone can continue to use the space. 

We have an inclusive and welcoming community, and these rules ensure it remains as such.

* You must behave in accordance with the rules
* You must use tools safely
* You must not use tools that require an induction without an induction
* Members can be asked to leave the space if they are breaking these rules.
* If you break the rules you may lose your membership

‚úÖ The rules can be read at any time [here](https://hacman.org.uk/rules).

## The Member Handbook explains the basics
We have a member handbook which provides a brief overview of the key aspects of our space. Please take a moment to flick through the member handbook so you're grounded in how the space operates such as:

- Emptying the bins
- Maintaining tools
- Parking and Transport
- How to report issues

‚úÖ You can read [a copy online](https://list.hacman.org.uk/t/member-handbook/2890/1)

‚úÖ There are two physical copies in the space:

- One is by the lightswitches as you come in
- The other is on the member noticeboard.

## Getting in the space for the first time
Access to the space is either by keycode, or fob. Your access method will start working once your first payment has gone through, and will only remain working as long as your membership is active.

### Keycode access - great for your first visit
In your membership account, go to [Keys and Codes](https://members.hacman.org.uk/account/0/edit#access), where you can generate an access code. These are 8 digits, randomly generated, and associated with your acocunt. 

üö´ Do not give your code out or write it down next to anything indicating it's for Hackspace Manchester.

### Fob access - great for convenience
On the signup desk as you come in, you'll find a holder of fobs and welcome leaflets. Choose a fob, then follow the instructions to add the fob to your account.

You'll need to enter this ID into the membership system in order to link the fob to your account. This is easy - when it arrives:

- Click "Your Membership" in the left hand menu
- Click "Edit" in the top right
- Enter your key fob ID in the "Key Fob" section 
- Click save.

## Some equipment needs an induction


‚ö†Ô∏è Inductions are mandatory for the more dangerous and expensive machines around the space.

These include but are not limited to:

 - the laser cutter
 - 3D printer 
 - lathes (wood, metal)
 - CNC machines
  
Some inductions require a small expense for test materials, the rest are free. Our inductions are run by volunteer members, and are a mixture of face to face instructions and online. You can find out what tools need inductions and how to book them through the tools & equipment page here on the membership system. 

‚úÖ Book inductions on the tool pages. 

Inductions are conducted in different ways, as stated on the tool page:

 - Some inductions are simply reading the manual, or watching some videos so you understand how to use and maintail the tool, others are done in person. 
 - Some are conducted online via Moodle at [https://moodle.hacman.org.uk] (https://moodle.hacman.org.uk) - to access this use your member system username and password. 
 - Some tools such as the Laser Cutter require an in-person induction

Once you have done the above you will be enrolled onto the appropriate moodle course for the induction and you should also make contact with a trainer to arrange any required in person training this can be done via moodle or through telegram

üö´ Using a tool inapproproately can mean you lose your inducted status.


## Storing Items in the space
Storage is strictly limited to either
- Members' Storage
- Large Project Storage

We operate a box of shame, where items left out are put into. They're rotated every week, and after three weeks, they're binned. If you see something left out, put it in the box of shame. Don't add tools or peoples' phones, valuables etc into it.

üö´ Do not store things around the space. It's fine to leave something out for a day if it needs to dry, but add a label explaining this, and make sure you store it properly within a day. Else it could get put in the box of shame.

### Members' Storage
Active members are permitted to store some things within a 600x400mm space. You need to claim your space on the membership system, which correlates to a physical storage area in the hackspace. 

‚úÖ To Claim a storage space, find a place that works for you in the hackspace, note the ID, then go to the membership system, and in the "Member Storage" page, and simply find the corresponding number and click claim.  

‚ö†Ô∏è If you do not claim a storage space that you're using, it could be cleared out. Make sure your box or items are labeled. Anything that is left after you leave the space may be destroyed, disposed of, moved or hacked.

### Large Project Storage
We have extremely limited space for the storage of large projects. This is detailed in the Member Handbook - but all projects stored there must be labelled appropriately with contact details, and be actively worked on.
