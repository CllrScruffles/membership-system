## Introduction

Hackspace Manchester is something we do together. It is a community. The infrastructure (building, equipment, tools, electric, internet etc) provides the foundations, and people working together with shared understandings and expectations are what provide a place of strong community.    

Every member is a citizen of the Hackspace Community and as such must follow the rules and guidelines in place to ensure that the community can exist safely and cohesively.

Please ensure you have read the Citizen Hackspace Agreement available here
